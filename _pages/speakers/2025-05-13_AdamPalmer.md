Tumor heterogeneity is a central difficulty of cancer treatment and causes practically all cancer therapies to vary in effectiveness between patients. Combination therapy is a key strategy to overcome heterogeneity, but predicting which drug combinations will be effective has been a long unsolved problem. Because single drugs are variably effective, we have built models around the idea that combination therapy in human populations involves ‘variable effects plus variable effects’. I will describe studies that apply this principle to understand and to accurately predict the population-level activity of combination therapies in human clinical trials, including treatments with curative effect.
